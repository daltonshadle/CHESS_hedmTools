# CHESS_hedmTools
A suite of tools or scripts for real-time experiemental processing and advanced data post-processing of high energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) data collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). These tools are heavily dependent on the hexrd project for X-ray diffraction analysis (https://github.com/HEXRD/hexrd).
